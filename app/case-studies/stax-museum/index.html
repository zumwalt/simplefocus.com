          <p>The Stax Museum of American Soul Music is hometown hallowed ground in Memphis, Tennessee. Tourists know the museum is a must-see attraction, but often don’t realize just how many of the songs they love came from this one place.</p>
          <p>Stax approached us to redesign their website to match the brand’s iconic style and encourage new visits by giving users a better sense of the museum.</p>

          </header>
          <p>Stax is more than music. It’s a physical place. We visited the museum as designers and fans, asking questions, dancing on the Soul Train dance floor and immersing ourselves in the museum experience so we could accurately translate it to the web.</p>

          <p>To make great music or great design everyone has to be on the same page. Before we started our initial design work, we held a mood board workshop with Stax’s team so we could better understand their ideas about their brand and its visual direction.</p>

        <p>Working with Simple Focus ... has been unlike any of the many web companies I have worked with in the past. Their creative process is refreshingly unorthodox in some ways but always thorough and with the best end result in mind at all times. Their team is fun but focused, and they engaged our staff every step of the way.</p>

          <p>Internal reviews, design revisions and client feedback helped us define three distinct visual strategies for the new homepage. Before settling on a final design direction, we surveyed more than 400 Stax visitors and fans to get their feedback.</p>

          <p>Stax asked us to rework their e-commerce front-end to grow online gift shop sales. They required an e-commerce platform that worked with their existing in-store Point-of-Sale system, so we helped them choose the right vendor, then worked with the vendor to re-skin the store to match the experience of the rest of the site.</p>
