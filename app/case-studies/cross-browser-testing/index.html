          <p>While they had built a great product, they were having trouble converting new customers from their marketing site and appealing to users who thought the original app&nbsp;was&nbsp;unappealing.</p>
          <p>We started by redesigning their homepage, header and footer to make the site more appealing to CBT’s&nbsp;core audience,&nbsp;designers.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Our next step was a complete visual and user experience overhaul of the application itself. We’ve worked hand-in-hand with the team at CrossBrowserTesting to continously release updates that simplify and enhance the application,  making it beautiful and easy to use.</p>
          <p>Live testing is the heart and soul of CrossBrowserTesting.com. We were tasked with helping users get started  as quickly and easily as possible. With hundreds of possible combinations of browsers, operating systems and plugins to choose from,  starting a new test, or resuming a previous one, couldn’t be easier.</p>
