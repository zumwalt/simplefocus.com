        <h1>When we consult with our clients, it helps us to know exactly what they have to go through to build and market their own products. That’s one of the reasons we own and operate Pulse, a cash flow management app for small businesses.</h1>
        <p>The other reason is because Pulse actually makes a difference in business owners’ lives. <strong>It lets small business owners easily monitor the heartbeat of their business—their cash.</strong></p>
        <p>Our users love its user-friendly interface and the power it gives them to monitor and forecast their cash flow. We’re constantly adding new features to improve Pulse and the way we market it.</p>
