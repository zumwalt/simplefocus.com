        <h1>War Untold is the lifelong passion of Andrew Pouncey. Its tells true stories from the Great War, stories that would otherwise be untold.</h1>
        <p>Design and development of WarUntold.com took about four months and included a hefty amount of research upfront. We watched documentaries, read history books, researched period-specific art and immersed ourselves in typography of the 1910s and ’20s.</p>
        <p>Deep into the project we realized our goal was not to design around the content, but to stay out of its way — what an honor.</p>
