            <p><strong>The Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) is a self-help portal, which is used by all current and retired Airmen to manage their benefits and personnel data. The AFPC was viewed poorly by its customers</strong> because it was slow, disorganized and hard to use. Busy Airmen in the field preferred to pick up the phone than use the portal to find information.</p>
